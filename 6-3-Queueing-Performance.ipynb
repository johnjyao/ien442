That is, if there are $k$ customers in the system, a new arrival will have a wait time that follows an $\\text{Erlang}(k, \\mu)$ distribution (the sum of the $k$ service requirements of those already in the system, including the remaining service time of the customer currently in service).\n",

Therefore, the steady-state performance metrics above are the same for a broad range of policys, not necessarily FCFS.  For example, if instead it were a *last*-come first-served policy, the expected wait time would be the same.  Also, if the next customer to be served was chosen randomly from all customers waiting in line, the expected wait time would be exactly the same.  Of course, the particular experience of an individual customer for a particular sample path will be different under these different policies, but the stochastic dynamics of the number of customers in the system are unchanged and, by Little's Law, many of the performance metrics of the system remain the same."
