    "# The Poisson Process: Section 3 - Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have analyzed the Poisson process over time intervals $[0, t]$, using the fact that the number of arrivals $N(t) \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda t)$.  Unfortunately, this requires that we start counting from time $0$.  How can we analyze the arrivals over a later time interval?  In the bus stop problem, we only considered the first bus that departs at time $d$, with the Poisson process starting at time $0$.  What about the second bus that departs at time $2d$ and takes all the passengers that arrive between $(d, 2d]$?\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out, due to some special properties of the Poisson process, that analyzing later time intervals is just as easy.  The main idea is that the counting process “renews” or starts over without any memory of the past."

In the case of $X_i \\sim \\text{Uniform}[a,b]$, it would no longer be true that the process renews at times $t$ between arrivals because the time since the previous arrival matters — for instance, if the time since the previous arrival is $r = t - S_{N(t)}$ then it is impossible for the next arrival to occur after $t + (b - r)$ (since it must be that $X_{N(t)+1} < b$): $$\\mathsf{P}(S_{N(t)+1} > t + (b - r)) = \\mathsf{P}(S_{N(t)+1} - t > b - r) = 0 \\neq \\mathsf{P}(X_1 > b - r)$$\n",

In other words, the Poisson process is a special type of renewal process where $X_i \\sim \\text{Exponential}(\\lambda)$ and has the additional property that it renews at any time $t$, not just arrival times."

This is similar to the fact that the exponential distribution is the only (continuous) distribution with the memoryless property.  It is possible to start from the assumption of the memoryless property and then conclude that the distribution must be exponential (a proof is given [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorylessness#Continuous_memorylessness))."
